The ALGORITHMS Project

--------- Algorithms that i will test---------
● Arrays: Object that holds items of same type
● Backtrack: Step by step process to find all possible solution to a problem
● Tree: Data Structure which is hierarchical in structure
● Graph: Abstract data type which implements undirected and directed graphs
● Linkedlist: Basically a list of node which point to next node
● Map: Basically a key-value pair
● Maths: Collection of math operation and algorithms involving it to solve problems
● Matrix: 2D array of items which can perform math operation on them
● Search: Ability to search using different search algorithms
● Sort: Ability to sort data using different sorting algorithms
● String: Fundamental data type in computer science

                                              Arrays
The documentation will get updated with each week as i again better understanding with the Project

The testing target for for the next pull request will be --Arrays--- algorithms.

delete_nth
    Basically this implementation solves the particular problem. Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list
that contains each number of the list at most N times without reordering.
For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], 
drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, 
which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3]
